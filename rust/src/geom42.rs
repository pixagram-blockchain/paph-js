//! SPEC-004.2 §4–§8 — the comparator-42 geometry stage.
//!
//! Comparator 41's `multimodel.rs` is untouched and stays reachable, because a
//! verdict that was issued has to remain reproducible.  This module is the
//! same *architecture* — mutual Lowe, weighted Hough, closed-form similarity,
//! iterative multi-model extraction, MAX over a structured null family — with
//! the four things that stop working once the budget doubles:
//!
//!   §4  the matcher.  512x512 is four times 256x256, so the inner loop stops
//!       computing distances it has already lost, and the acceptance test gains
//!       an ABSOLUTE margin beside the ratio (d1=2 vs d2=3 passes Lowe at 0.667
//!       and means almost nothing).
//!   §5  the vote.  A `HashMap` keyed by cell plus a `Vec` per correspondence
//!       was affordable at 256 correspondences and is not at 512: the cells are
//!       a bounded integer space, so the table is a fixed open-addressed one
//!       and the per-correspondence cell list is a stack array.  Scale stops
//!       being a hard bucket.
//!   §6  the peak.  Weighted mass alone cannot tell four overwhelming matches
//!       from a genuinely populated transformation, so the peak is compared
//!       lexicographically on (mass, members, confidence) and the model carries
//!       a median residual.
//!   §7  consumption.  One physical structure must not be decomposed into two
//!       models because the first one's inliers stopped one keypoint short.
//!
//! Nothing here is float, and nothing here is order-dependent: the vote table
//! is scanned by slot but reduced by an explicit total order on (mass, members,
//! confidence, key), so the answer does not depend on where a key landed.
